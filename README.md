# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    The Corner Grocer project is a item-tracking program that reads a text document and produces lists of groceries purchased. 

# What did you do particularly well?
    First, I handled the user-interface in C++ efficiently with input validation as well as the functions in C++ and Python. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    Though, I can add input validation in case 2 when user is asked for an item; Example: If user enters a item that doesn't exist, then it would prompt 'item not found, enter new item' until user enters a item that exists within the dictionary: inventory. Essentially, The frequency search starts, once the item is determined to exist. This change should increase the security of the code by preventing invalid item frequency searches that would always return zero. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    Next, the most challenging piece of code to write was the output function and not generating a extra line in 'frequency.dat'. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    The python courses through Datacamp helped me with the python implementation, particularly when working with dictionaries and lists. Stackoverflow and C by Example are useful resources when referencing examples for tricky concepts. This project may transfer some skills over to any other projects that require a user-interface or small data that needs to be sorted. 
  
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    Finally, I made the program maintainable by writing well documented code with variable names indicative of use and including whitespaces to help readability.
