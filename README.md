# Cplusplus-Corner_Grocer

    Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    What did you do particularly well?
    Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
    What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
    How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

1. The Corner Grocer project is a item-tracking program that analyzes a text document and produces lists of groceres purchased. 
2. I handled the user-interface in C++ efficiently with input validation as well as the functions in C++ and Python. 
3. I could enhance the input validation in case 2 when user is asked for an item; It would print 'item not found, enter new item' until user enters a item that exists within dictionary: inventory.
4. The most challenging piece of code to write was the output function and avoiding a extra new line in 'frequency.dat' 
5. This project may transfer some skills over to any other projects that need a user-interface or data that needs to be sorted
6. I made the program readable by writing well documented code with variable names indicative of use and whitespaces whenever neccessary.
