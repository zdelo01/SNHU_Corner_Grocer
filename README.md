# Cplusplus-Corner_Grocer
Zachary DeLong - CS-210 - SNHU

The Corner Grocer project is a item-tracking program that analyzes a text document and produces lists of groceries purchased. First, I handled the user-interface in C++ efficiently with input validation as well as the functions in C++ and Python. Though, I can add input validation in case 2 when user is asked for an item; It would prompt 'item not found, enter new item' until user enters a item that exists within dictionary: inventory. Essentially, The frequency search starts, once the item passes the check. This change may increase the security of the code and will prevent invalid item frequency searches that provide no relevant information for the user. The most challenging piece of code to write was the output function and not generating a extra line in 'frequency.dat'. The python courses through Datacamp helped me with the python integration, particularly when working with dictionaries. Stackoverflow and C by Example are great resources when referencing examples for tricky concepts. This project may transfer some skills over to any other projects that require a user-interface or small data that needs to be sorted. Finally, I made the program readable by writing well documented code with variable names indicative of use and whitespaces whenever neccessary.
