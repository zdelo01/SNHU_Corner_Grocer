# Cplusplus-Corner_Grocer
Zachary DeLong - CS-210 - SNHU

The Corner Grocer project is a item-tracking program that reads a text document and produces lists of groceries purchased. First, I handled the user-interface in C++ efficiently with input validation as well as the functions in C++ and Python. Though, I can add input validation in case 2 when user is asked for an item; Example: If user enters a item that doesn't exist, then it would prompt 'item not found, enter new item' until user enters a item that exists within the dictionary: inventory. Essentially, The frequency search starts, once the item is determined to exist. This change should increase the security of the code by preventing invalid item frequency searches that would always return zero. Next, the most challenging piece of code to write was the output function and not generating a extra line in 'frequency.dat'. The python courses through Datacamp helped me with the python implementation, particularly when working with dictionaries and lists. Stackoverflow and C by Example are useful resources when referencing examples for tricky concepts. This project may transfer some skills over to any other projects that require a user-interface or small data that needs to be sorted. Finally, I made the program maintainable by writing well documented code with variable names indicative of use and including whitespaces to help readability.
